# Overview
The code in this folder is used to analyze GTEx data 

# Data Sources

# Scripts
## 00-paths.R (all three)
This script defines the paths to local storage areas for `raw`, `clean` and `scratch` data spaces for GTEx project. The sample `.json` file should get modified by each developer to refer to the correct location of the data. In Windows machines the `.json` file goes to `C:\Users\username\Documents\Paths` folder.
